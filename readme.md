 *STAR RATING SYSTEM*

This is just a part of an app, star rating system made for any kind of website,application, or even some companies at the doors have star rating apps. For customers to give rating based on their experience. 

This simple widget works this way:
There's a five-star rating. When user clicks any star,gets different explanation. (from 1 star - I hate it, to 5 stars - I love it!). Below there's a textbox where user can describe their experience (doesn't have to,user can just rate). And, below,there's a "post" button. 
When user clicks "post", he gets a message "thanks for rating us!",and down ,there's a clickable "see others' ratings and comments". If user doesn't click, after 10 seconds,message will disappear and star-widget will come back.
If user clicks to see ratings and comments from others, there is new section: A home button,where he can go to the star-widget, average rating and of course, ratings and comments below. 

Widget is coded in html,css and JavaScript.

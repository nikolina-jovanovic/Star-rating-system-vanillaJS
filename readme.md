This simple widget works this way:
There's a five-star rating. When user clicks any star,gets different explanation. (from 1 star - I hate it, to 5 stars - I love it!). Below there's a textbox where user can describe their experience (doesn't have to,user can just rate). And, below,there's a "post" button. 
When user clicks "post", he gets a message "thanks for rating us!",and down ,there's a clickable "see others' ratings and comments". If user doesn't click, after 10 seconds,message will disappear and star-widget will come back.
If user clicks to see ratings and comments from others, there is new section: A home button,where he can go to the star-widget, average rating and of course, ratings and comments below. 

Widget is coded in html,css and JavaScript.
